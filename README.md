# PyCitySchool_Analysis

### Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this assignment was to fimiliarize ourselves with jupyter notebook and using the pandas library. We were tasked with doing analysis on a 
school district and reporting the results to our supervisor Maria. In our analysis we looked at how schools performed on their yearly math and reading standardized test scores.
We looked at multiple variables including the size of the school, its budget, the type of school, how many student attended the school, and how this all compared to how well
each school performed.

Unfortunately, after our initial analysis we were notified that some 9th grade students attending Thomas High school had shown some indications of academic dishonestly and we
would have to replace the entire grade's scores with null values.



## Results
  ### How is the district summary affected
  First, by replacing the 9th grader's reading and math scores from Thomas High School with null values the district was affected in the following ways;
  
    -The average math score went down 0.1 from 79.0 to 78.9
    -The average reading score stayed the same at 81.9
    -The percent passing math went down 0.2% from 75% to 74.8%
    -The percent passing reading went down 0.3% from 86% to 85.7%
    -The overall percent passing both test went down 0.1% from 65% to 64.9%
  
  
  ### How is the school summary affected?
  
  
  
  ### How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High school relative to other schools?
  Replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores with null values did not affect the over standing too much. Thomas High School still was second in the overall
  performing schools in the district.
  
  Below you can see the top five schools in our initial anaylsis.

  And below this, you can see the top five schools in our analysis after replacing the scores with null values.

  ### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following?
  
  ### Math and reading scores by grade?
  
  
  ### Scores by school spending.
  
  Changing the math and reading values of the ninth-grader's at Thomas High School had no change on how well the district did based on the spending ranges per student.
  Below is an image of how well the district performed based on how much the school was budgetted per student. There was no change from our initial analysis to our new analysis.

  ### Scores by school size?
   Changing the math and reading values of the ninth-grader's at Thomas High School had no change on how well the district did based on how many students attended the school.
   Below is an image of how well the district performed based on student population. There was no change from our initial analysis to our new analysis.

  ### Scores by school type?
   Changing the math and reading values of the ninth-grader's at Thomas High School had no change on how well the district did based on the type of school.
   Below is an image of how well the different types of school performed compared to one another, the results for our initial analysis and our new analysis are the same.

  ### Summary
  
   The only changes in the school district analysis after reading and  math scores have been replaced are the overall district scores mentioned at the very top of this 
   analysis. It looks as though changes the scores to null values did not affect the district or the school very much. But in a larger analysis, comparing hundreds if not          thousands of school, this could definitely be  different story.
